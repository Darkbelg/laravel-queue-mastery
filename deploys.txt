Supervisors

php artisan queue:restart -->
Restarts the worker if it doesn't have any jobs.
Be careful if it is accessing the database during a deployment the job might fail if there is a migration.
So we have to use the stop command and then deploy

sudo supervisorctl stop worker-123123:*
Deployment
sudo supervisorctl start worker-123123:*
